Usage:\n\n    var curve = require('curve25519');\n\nMethods\n=======\n`curve.makeSecretKey(secret)`\n-----------------------------\nProvide it with a 32-bytes-long `Buffer` and it will be modified in-place in order to be a usable secret key. Doesn't return anything.\n\n`curve.derivePublicKey(secret)`\n-------------------------------\nProvide it with your secret key as a 32-bytes-long `Buffer` and get a `Buffer` containing your public key as the result.\n\n`curve.deriveSharedSecret(mysecret, hispublic)`\n-----------------------------------------------\nDerive your shared secret with someone else by giving this function two 32-bytes-long buffers containing your secret key and the other persons public key. Returns a `Buffer`.\n\nInstalling\n==========\nNot yet on npm, I will only put it there when it's stable. Just work with `git clone` and `npm link`.\n",
